 # Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
 # If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

 # Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
 # no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
 # You can use `rails secret` to generate a secure secret key.

 # Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
 # if you're sharing your code publicly.

 # Shared secrets are available across all environments.

 # Environmental secrets are only available for that specific environment.
